"""
This is the top level module of ebisim.

The ebisim package offers a number of tools to perform and evaluate simulations of the charge
breeding process in an Electron Beam Ion Source / Trap.

For easier access a number of submodule members are available at this level, such that they can be
referred to as ebisim.[member] without resolving the submodule in the call.
The module level documentation lists these members with more granularity.
